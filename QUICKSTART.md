## Fruit Picking Guide

1. Approaching Fruits:

   - Watch for yellow distance indicator
   - Line shows path to nearest fruit
   - Indicator turns green when in range

2. Picking Process:
   - Move close to fruit (green indicator)
   - Position arm near fruit
   - Hold Space to grip
   - Fruit disappears when picked

## Demo Mode

1. Automatic Demonstrations:

   - Arm movement patterns
   - Driving capabilities
   - Turning demonstrations
   - Gripper operation

2. Switching to Manual:
   - Press X to disable demo
   - Status turns green
   - Controls become active

## Visual Feedback

1. Status Messages:

   - Green: Controls enabled
   - Cyan: Demo mode
   - Yellow: Fruit distance
   - White: General info

2. Environment Markers:
   - Grid pattern for navigation
   - Distance lines to fruits
   - Picking range indicators
   - Movement feedback

## Quick Tests

1. Movement Check:

   - Enable controls (X)
   - Move forward (W)
   - Turn left/right (A/D)
   - Check smooth acceleration

2. Fruit Picking:
   - Approach orange
   - Watch distance indicator
   - Wait for green signal
   - Use gripper (Space)

## Troubleshooting

1. If Controls Don't Work:

   - Check status color
   - Press X to toggle
   - Ensure window focus
   - Try resetting (R)

2. If Fruits Don't Pick:

   - Get closer to fruit
   - Wait for green indicator
   - Position arm correctly
   - Hold Space button

3. Performance Issues:
   - Close other applications
   - Reduce window size
   - Update graphics drivers
   - Check CPU/Memory usage

## Getting Help

1. Debug Information:

   - Watch status messages
   - Check distance indicators
   - Monitor console output
   - Verify control state

2. Common Solutions:
   - Reset simulation
   - Restart program
   - Check error messages
   - Follow visual guides
